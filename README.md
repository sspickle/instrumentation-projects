# instrumentation-projects

This repo is no longer used by the course, but I'm keeping it here for historical interest.

A collection of instrumentation projects for PHYS-230. Mostly python, but also Arduino, PSoC etc. Hopefully someone will find this useful!

You can find links to most of the materials [here](README.ipynb).
