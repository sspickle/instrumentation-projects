    "This project has *two* primary goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use an external peripheral that communicates with the microcontroller using a serial protocol of some kind (e.g., $i^2c$, SPI, etc.), \n",
    "2. to use the microcontroller to collect some data with the notion of making a statistical case that the data collected was legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to select at least *one* $i^2c$, SPI, or serial (RS232) *peripheral* for your project. You also need to make some kind of measurement as a part of your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use an $i^2c$ sensor to measure something. Set up an experiment where you deliberately modify the environment to get a recognizable change in the measured quantity. Use the data collected, and details of the experiment you conducted to argue that your sensor was operating correctly.\n",
    "2. Use an analog sensor to measure something (e.g., temperature). Use an $i^2c$ display to present the results of those measurements in real time.\n",
    "3. Use an $i^2c$ joystick to interact with the experiment, send the data collected to the computer over the serial port.\n",

    "\n",
    "RS-232 is a three wire \"synchronous\" serial communication standard designed to provide easy transfer of data between two devices such as a computer and a \"dumb terminal (keyboard/screen)\" or between two computers. Each endpoint has a minimum of three wires: Transmit (Tx), Receive (Rx) and Ground (Gnd). The two devices need to agree on a predetermined 'data rate' that is generally one of a fixed set of options (measured in 'bits per second'). There are some additional \"handshaking\" wires that can be used when one device needs extra time bewteen bytes for processing so that it can indicate that it's not prepared for new communication (e.g., Data Set Ready (DTR), Data Terminal Ready (DTR) Ready To Send (RTS), etc.). The good news is that most devices can work well at useful speeds with only three wires, so that's what we'll be doing. If you've used the OpenLog module (think ENGR 196, if you've taken it) you've used an RS-232 connection since that's how that device works. Also, the USB cable we use to program the Arduino becomes a virtual RS-232 connection when you connect using the \"Serial Monitor\" of the Arduino IDE.\n",

I would recommend one of the pre-built distributions like anaconda: <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>.
