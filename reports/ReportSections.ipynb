    "Each project has two components:\n",
    "1. An electronics project involving concepts directly related designing, prototyping, or testing laboratory instrumentation (e.g, programmable microcontrollers, instrument controllers, sensors, and data acquisition systems).\n",
    "2. A data analysis project focusing primarily on processing, interpreting, and making inferences from the data acquired in (1).\n",

    "Plagiarism: While students will work in teams to complete part 1, and they are welcome to work collaboratively in developing solutions to part 2, the report that each student submits documenting their work must be the result of their own effort. You may certainly share data within a group (not between groups) and you can share artifacts (e.g., schematics, photos, drawings) but your written words should be entirely your own personal product, not derived from the work of any other person."

    "The abstract should be 1-3 sentences at most. Describe a) what you measured, b) how you measured it and c) the final result of your analysis, including some measure of uncertainty. Not a great deal of detail, but enough to answer these basic questions. So for example in this report we could say: The measured resistance was $R = 19.2 \\pm 1.3\\,k \\Omega$.\n",

    "\"In this project we investigated the I-V behavior of a photoresistor. A photoresistor is a resistor with a variable resistance that depends on the intensity of light falling on the photosensitive surface of the device. We set the light-level at a fixed value and connected a known current sense resistor in series with the photoresistor. By applying a series of known fixed voltages across the series combination and measuring voltage drop across the photoresistor we were able to infer the current through the device. This was then used, along with the voltage drop, to evaluate the resistance of the photoresistor.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important**: You should always include a schematic describing the circuit you *actually* built in the lab. If you had to select component values that were not provided this is where you'd explain those design decisions. This usually involves using the requirements of the design, and the expected behavior of the circuit elements, to determine what values make sense. Please don't just say \"we tried a bunch of different values for $R_1$ and things seemed to work best at around $330\\,\\Omega$.\n",

If there is data, either present the actual values (if it's not too much) or show some representative values, and make a graph showing it all. Be sure to label your data and graphs very clearly so it's obvious what you're presenting. Be sure to use correct units. If you wrote code to control the project, or to collect measurements, include that code here. If you wrote code to translate raw data into sensible units, that can go here as well."
