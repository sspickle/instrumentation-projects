    "This project has two primary goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce students to PSoC technology (in particular [the cypress PSOC-6](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-ble-prototyping-kit-cy8cproto-063-ble)\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Introduce concepts of digital logic and hardware, including comparators, gates and flip-flops.\n",

    "Build on part of the circuit at a time. First add *just* the op-amp. Then test it. Then add the comparator, then test *that*, and so on.\n",

    "For `Vin`, use a sinusoidal output from the function generator. Be sure to keep the voltage in the range +/- 3.3V. Start with a frequency of 500 Hz to match the video. After you have things working, you can play around with the frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `VCMP`, use the DC bench supply. Also, keep the voltage in the range 0-3.3V.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the bench scope to verify each part of your circuit is working properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs on `Pin_1`, `Pin_2`, and `Pin_3` should be square wave signals with frequencies of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 of the original sine frequency, respectively.\n",
