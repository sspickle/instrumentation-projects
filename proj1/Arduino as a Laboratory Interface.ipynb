    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. to familiarize yourself with some of the tools we'll be using in this course: the Arduino compiler, simulator, and microcontroller, electronic breadboards, oscilloscopes, \"C\" programming, \"python\" programming and jupyter notebooks, AND\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. to build a simple circuit that enables us to study the behvior of an LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress through the project please be sure to ask questions and get help if you are confused or unclear on how to proceed. Since most students taking this course have used python in intro physics, and have at least one course in programming computers in \"c\" or \"c++\". As a result the treatment of those topics will be fairly brief. If you have not use python and/or c/c++ before please alert your instructor and they will provide you with extra materials and instruction as necessary.\n",

Wouldn't it be nice if we could communicate that to them in some simple way? That's one of the most useful applications of a commonly used compiler directive called a \"macro\". You can create your own macros (I like to do this at the very beginning of my programs, so they are easy to find). Here's how it works:\n",

When the compiler sees this macro it then knows that anywhere in the program that has 'LED' it's to be replaced by the value '13'. Then our digitalWrite function call looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Isn't that clearer? Of course it is. ;-) Below is a list of macros that we can use to define constants needed by the program to run project 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #define OUTPIN 3          // apply output voltage to pin 3\n",
    "    #define IN_ANALOG 0       // which analog pin are we reading?\n",
    "    #define NUMVALUES 40      // how much data to collect?\n",

    "Because these definitions are constant, they can't be changed during execution. It is a convention to use all upper case characters in the names of constants so the reader can tell that these things are not variable in the context in which they appear.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Variables\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs need some values that can change. These are *variables*. A variable needs to be decared with a type and within a scope. The *type* of a variable determines the amount of memory required for the variable's value and the scope determines the times during which the variable is needed during program execution. Basically if the variable is declared outside of any function, it's scope is *global* and it is always available. If it is declared within a function it's scope is *local* (only within the function). It's memory is 'allocated' within the function, and 'released' outside the function. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    int x;\n",
    "\n",
    "This declares `x` to be an integer (16 bits on the Arduino) and since it's not inside a function, it's scope is global. Here's another:\n",

    "    int foo(int y) {\n",
    "        int x=y;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        if (y>9) {\n",
    "            x = 3*y;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return 100 - x;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `x` is a local variable that is only defined within the function `foo`. You can see that it is used as a part of computing the result of the function. If you tried to access the value of `x` outside this function the compiler would complain that `x` is undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a collection of memory of a particular type. An array is declared using square brakets: `[]` like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    int myArray[16];\n",
    "    \n",
    "this would allocated an array called `myArray` with space for 16 integers. You can access individual elements within the array by using that particular element's address or `index`. The index values start at zero and go up to one less than the number of elements, in this case, 15. For example to set the `zeroth` element of `myArray` to 9 you'd use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    myArray[0] = 9;\n",

    "\n",
    "Handling Conditions\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want one thing to happen `if` a variable has one value, and something `else` to happen if it has a different value. This is most easily accomplished using an `if` statement. Here is a simple example. Suppose we have a heater and a temperature sensor. We decide that we want the heater to run if the temperature sensor measures any voltage *below* 0.488V, and we want to turn it off if it measures *above* 0.488V. Suppose further that the temperature sensor is connected to analog input pin 0, and the heater is connected to digital output pin 3. This code would do the trick:\n",

    "    #define IN_ANALOG 0\n",

    "        Serial.println(\"Voltage is below 0.488 Volts\");\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AnalogRead` function is used to measure analog voltages on the analog input pins of the Arduino Microcontroller. Voltages bewteen 0.0V and 5.0V are mapped onto integer values between 0 and 1023. The `DigitalWrite` function sets an output pin `high` (which is 5.0V) or `low` (which is 0.0V) as shown. This example sets pin 3 high (5V) if the voltage on analog input 0 is below 0.488 Volts and sets pin 3 low (0V) if the voltage on analog input 0 is above 0.488 V. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Loops\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to create looping behaviors in \"c\", but the most common is the `for` loop. Here is an example `for` loop that sets all the elements of `myArray` to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #define N 16\n",
    "\n",
    "    int i;\n",

    "    for (i=0; i<N; i++) {\n",
    "        myArray[i] = 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "The `for` loop begins with `for` and contains a set of three expressions (clauses) separated by semi-colons. The three expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. initialize the loop control variable(s), `(i=0)`\n",
    "2. check to see if the loop should continue and `(i<N)`\n",
    "3. update the loop control variables `(i++)`\n",
    "\n",
    "respectively. Let's look at those parts one at a time. First `i` is initialized to zero. This way we know where things are starting. Since the goal of this loop is to set all the elements of `myArray` to zero this means we'll be starting with the `zeroth` element. Before the loop exectutes each iteration it evaluates the middle clause to see if it should continue execution. In this case it checks to see if `i<N`. Since `N` is `#define`ed to be 16, this is checking to make sure `i<16`. The first time through the loop `i=0` so this is clearly satisfied. Remeber that the last element of the array has an index `i=15` so checking that `i<16` will allow no higher index than this. Good! Each time the loop completes the `update` clause `(i++)` is exectuted. `i++` is shorthand in \"c\" for `i=i+1`. This increments the loop control variable `i` by one at the end of each iteration. Note the net effect is that the loop is exectuted once for each value of `i` from `i=0` to `i=15`.\n",

    "Functions\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a body of code that encapsulates some operation. Sometimes functions produce a result that is desired, sometimes they produce side effects that are needed. Here is an example function that produces a result:\n",
